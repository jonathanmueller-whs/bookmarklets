# Bookmarklets

A place to host scripts for bookmarklets. 

## Purpose:

Github pages allows me to host the scripts I write and use as bookmarkets, keeping the bookmarkets themselves simple and **_static_**. 
If I need to make updates to them to add features or fix bugs, the bookmarklets themselves don't need to change and they ultimately source their code from here.

Each script has it's own readme.md file to help you get started and list out any quirks you might experience. (Yes, sometimes my code is buggy. :P)

## List of Bookmarklets:
- [Time Differ](/time-differ/)
- [Scan Response Getter](/scan-response-getter/)
